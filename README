	sudo apt install liballegro5.2 liballegro-ttf5.2 liballegro-image5.2 liballegro-audio5.2 liballegro-acodec5.2 libfftw3-3

The game uses CMake as build system, so its building process is pretty typical.

	git submodule update
	sudo apt install liballegro5-dev liballegro-ttf5-dev liballegro-image5-dev liballegro-audio5-dev liballegro-acodec5-dev libfftw3-dev

Compilation:

	mkdir build; cd build
	cmake ..
	make
